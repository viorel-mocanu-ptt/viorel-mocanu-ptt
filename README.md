# Hi there! 👋

- First of all, this is my `work` GitHub account. My personal one is here: https://github.com/ViorelMocanu
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few projects including [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/) and [my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ViorelMocanu) (on my alternative GitHub account [ViorelMocanu](https://github.com/ViorelMocanu)).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating easy to use starter projects for people beginning their journey in IT, front end, back end, devops, etc.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with editing my YouTube videos and QA for the projects I'm building pro bono.
- 💬 Ask me about how to start a career in design or development.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UpnAutz), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ViorelMocanu), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ViorelMocanu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorelmocanu/) or [my personal site](https://www.viorelmocanu.ro/) (in 🇷🇴 Romanian only for now, planning to start an 🇬🇧🇸 English version soon).
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started out in Front End Development in the 1990's, when [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com/) (with [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)) and others were fighting to create and uphold Web Standards. We now live by them and it's a wonderful time to start working in the field, so I'm devoting part of my time to encourage you to do so.
